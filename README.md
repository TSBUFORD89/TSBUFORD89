- 👋 Hi, I’m @TSBUFORD89
- 👀 I’m interested in computer, fashion, music, mediation, coding and building businesses.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code properly. I have done it in the past playing around but now I want to learn as muchc as possible about coding. I am also learning how to build my business from the ground up in order to make my imprint on th world.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding of course. lol I feel the more I know the more I learn so I am always willing to learn something new or shortcuts into everything I am doing
- 📫 How to reach me... currently not reachable but I will be once I have learned everything I need to know. I would love to work with someone on creation of webpages to get a mroe hands on feel for the line of work I want to do.
